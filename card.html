			<p>Found in shallow tropical and temperate waters throughout the world, these upright-swimming relatives of the pipefish
				can range in size from 0.6 inches to 14 inches long. Male seahorses are equipped with a brood pouch on their ventral,
				or front-facing, side. When mating, the female deposits her eggs into his pouch, and the male fertilizes them internally.
				He carries the eggs in his pouch until they hatch, then releases fully formed, miniature seahorses into the water1. </p>
